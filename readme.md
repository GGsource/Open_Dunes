# The Open Dunes Project
---
## Summary:
The goal is to implement a version of a "falling sand" game using OpenGL while also learning how to work with OpenGL. I have plenty of ambitious ideas but the main goal is to learn how making a game of this kind is possible. 

### Short Term Goals
- Implement placing of particles via clicking with mouse
- Implement UI for picking between the available particle types to place
- Make sand particle fall and have expected behaviors
- Make water particle flow like a liquid and have expected behaviors

### Mid Term Goal - Thermal System
- Create heat as a particle attribute
- Implement heat dispersion/ heat transfer mechanics
- Implement fire particle as primary heat source
- Implement alternate particle which absorbs heat
- Implement new particle forms when exposed to thermal changes, such as water vapor, ice, or even glass

### Long Term Goal - Fusion with Life Simulation
- Take this concept and bring in creatures capable of evolving over generations which have complex neural networks to decide their behaviors.
- Implement mutations to usher evolutionary changes
- Create interaction between sandbox environment and these creatures

### Miscelaneous Wishes
- Implementation of lightning, particularly hitting sand and creating glass
- Implementation of wind and air that can push powders in a given direction
- Implementation of flammable particles such as wood
- Exploration of what Rigid bodies would look like in the falling sand world
- Creation of a player character in the sandbox, with movement
